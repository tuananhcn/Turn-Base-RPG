## A playable combatant that carries out [BattlerActions] as its [member readiness] charges.
##
## Battlers are the playable characters or enemies that show up in battle. They have [BattlerStats],
## a list of [BattlerAction]s to choose from, and respond to a variety of stimuli such as status
## effects and [BattlerHit]s, which typically deal damage or heal the Battler.
##
## [br][br]Battlers have [BattlerAnim]ation children which play out the Battler's actions.

## Emitted when the battler finished their action and arrived back at their rest position.
signal action_finished
## Forwarded from the receiving of [signal BettlerStats.health_depleted].
signal health_depleted
## Emitted when taking damage or being healed from a [BattlerHit].
## [br][br]Note the difference between this and [signal BattlerStats.health_changed]:
## 'hit_received' is always the direct result of an action, requiring graphical feedback.
signal hit_received(value: int)
## Emitted whenever a hit targeting this battler misses.
signal hit_missed
## Emitted when the battler's `_readiness` changes.
signal readiness_changed(new_value)
## Emitted when the battler is ready to take a turn.
signal ready_to_act
## Emitted when modifying `is_selected`. The user interface will react to this for
## player-controlled battlers.
